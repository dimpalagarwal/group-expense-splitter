# group-expense-splitter
Group Expense Splitter is a web application designed to simplify the way groups manage shared expenses. 
Instead of manually calculating who owes whom, the app automatically tracks expenses, calculates fair shares, 
and presents clear settlement results. By showing detailed, pairwise, and optimized views of transactions, 
the tool ensures transparency, accuracy, and ease of use for everyday group activities like trips, outings, 
or shared living.
